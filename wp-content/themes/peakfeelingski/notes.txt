jQuery for calculations on customer page

Setup Gravity Forms & Stripe

Thoughts for product page....
    Lift passes & tuition have a custom text field for you guys to personalize
        Any other products to have that?
    Al the rest to have custom prices per customer? Or a set price?
    Add a product header field and remove the hard coded ones? This can help with multiple blocks of the same type.

Different functionality for different products?
    Separate Pricing!
    Different Layout...
    Links to ski schools / lift pass price list

Integrate Booking form on contact page


Use an invisible form to record the boxes checked and send to an email?
