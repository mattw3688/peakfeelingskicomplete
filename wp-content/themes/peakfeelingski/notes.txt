Thoughts for product page....
    Lift passes & tuition have a custom text field for you guys to personalize
        Any other products to have that?
    Al the rest to have custom prices per customer? Or a set price?
    Add a product header field and remove the hard coded ones? This can help with multiple blocks of the same type.

Add ability to add logos to the description for different facilities.
- Decide which are on every product.. ie capacity, distance to slopes
- Enable check box system to add all the rest.
- Specific for product type
